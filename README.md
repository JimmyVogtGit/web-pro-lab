## projects bootstraping and labs

My main objective is exploring code and web features.
For this, I will start this repo to iterate several times on each implementation in order to have automatisms and be as productive as possible.
This repo will allow for trial and error and the implementation of professional stacks from bootstrapping to deployment.
